### My Math/Computer Science Journey <a name="Math/CS"/>
I've been interested in mathematics since elementary school. I loved the computation involved in algebra, geometry, calculus, and competition math. I had the chance to attend the [Mu Alpha Theta National Convention](https://mualphatheta.org/national-convention) in 2017, a memorable experience.

More recently, in my college experience I was introduced to proof-based math. I've enjoyed much of it so far and intend to continue exploring the divisions between conceptual and applied mathematics

I was introduced to programming for the first time in high school through the AP Computer Science course in Java. Since then, I have learned Python, Java, C, HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP and more. I enjoy how the principles of computer science can be used to develop algorithmic solutions to problems

### Research and Internship Experience <a name="Research"/>

#### MSRI-UP
I participated in the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in which the focus was parking functions and their variants
(June 2021 - Present)

#### CyVerse
Worked at CyVerse as an intern. This involved GitHub workflow configuration, unit testing, app construction in Python, algorithm implementation, and python module construction. One project involved developing a tkinter application for viewing, manipulating, and processing geotiff images to be overlaid on a map
(March 2020 - May 2021)

#### Selenium
Learned how to use and built applications via Python’s selenium module for navigating websites, generating and parsing input, web scraping, and performing click events. Operations could take place via a headless or non-headless browser. 
(July 2020 - August 2020)

#### Scripting for All
Researched for Harvey Mudd College’s computer science department which involved creating games, mazes, AI maze-solvers, and simulations in Python. The UI was via matplotlib and terminal depending on which a user chose. The purpose was for educators to implement these in their respective curriculums at the middle and high school levels.
(June 2019 - July 2019)
