<h2 align="center">My Math/Computer Science Journey <a name="Math/CS"/></h2>
I've been interested in mathematics since elementary school. I loved the computation involved in algebra, geometry, calculus, and competition math. I also have always been around a community of teachers and pers who have also appreciated mathematics and supported me through my journey, and I thank them for this. I had the chance to attend the [Mu Alpha Theta National Convention](https://mualphatheta.org/content/2017-national-convention-buffalo-ny) in 2017, a memorable experience. It gave me more insights into what can potentially be done with math. In addition to being a compteition, the convention also hosted talks regarding mathematics from a variety of panels and mathematicians.

More recently, in my college experience I was introduced to proof-based math. I've enjoyed much of it so far and intend to continue exploring the divisions between conceptual and applied mathematics

I was introduced to programming for the first time in high school through an AP Computer Science course in Java. Since then, I have learned Python, Java, C, HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP and more. I enjoy how the principles of computer science can be used to develop algorithmic solutions to problems. For me it is a fun puzzle, fitting together lines of code which by themselves may seem simple, into a larger problem that often requires thought. Although this is not true among many in the discipline, I enjoy debugging, as it offers me opportunities to expand my problem solving abilities and to seek resources I can use to find a solution

<h2 align="center">Research and Internship Experience<a name="Research"/></h2>

#### MSRI-UP
I participated in the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in which the focus was parking functions and their variants
(June 2021 - Present)

#### CyVerse
Worked at CyVerse as an intern. This involved GitHub workflow configuration, unit testing, app construction in Python, algorithm implementation, and python module construction. One project involved developing a tkinter application for viewing, manipulating, and processing geotiff images to be overlaid on a map
(March 2020 - May 2021)

#### Selenium
Learned how to use and built applications via Python’s selenium module for navigating websites, generating and parsing input, web scraping, and performing click events. Operations could take place via a headless or non-headless browser. 
(July 2020 - August 2020)

#### Scripting for All
Researched for Harvey Mudd College’s computer science department which involved creating games, mazes, AI maze-solvers, and simulations in Python. The UI was via matplotlib and terminal depending on which a user chose. The purpose was for educators to implement these in their respective curriculums at the middle and high school levels.
(June 2019 - July 2019)

<h2 align="center">My Other Interests<a name="Interests"/></h2>
I am interested in a variaey of topics outside of my majors, including history, anthropology, palentology, science, trackand field, chess, and more. I'm always open to learning and hope to bring this eagerness to whichever projects I undertake.
